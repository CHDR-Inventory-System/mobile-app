# CHDR Inventory System - Mobile App

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= `16.0.0`.

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory that looks like:

```properties
# This value may need to be changed depending on what host and port
# the server is running on. By default, it's 127.0.0.1
DEBUG_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
PROD_API_URL=prod-url-here
```

Once you've cloned the repository, run `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn start` to start the project.
